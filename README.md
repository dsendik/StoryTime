# StoryTime

StoryTime is an application where amatuer writers can make use of interesting prompts, imagery, and others' contributions to help inspire their own creativity in story writing. Through a list of curated prompts to practice short stories, users can hone their writing abilities. If you are simply a reader, the prompts also provide quick fun stories with interesting ideas. StoryTime is inspired by Reddit's r/WritingPromts.
